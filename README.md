Deprecated coins
In an effort to enhance the overall user experience and focus on the most widely used cryptocurrencies, we will be discontinuing support for certain coins in Trezor Suite.
 
Beginning in February 2025, Trezor Suite will discontinue support for Dash, Bitcoin Gold, DigiByte, Namecoin, and Vertcoin. Users are advised to migrate their funds to alternative wallets to ensure continued access and security.
 
Please note that the assets will still be supported by the Trezor firmware, so you can continue to protect your funds by using your Trezor hardware wallet and a suitable third party application.
 
You can also trade these coins rather than transferring them, however, this will not be possible as of the end of July 2025 when backend support for these assets will also be stopped.

Why are we deprecating these coins?
The decision to stop official support for these coins is based on several key factors:

    Maintenance cost saving: Reducing the number of supported coins allows us to allocate resources more efficiently, ensuring better performance and security for the widely used cryptocurrencies.
    Prevention of future problems: By focusing on the most relevant coins, we minimize the risk of technical complications and potential issues down the line.
    Normalizing coin removal: As the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, it's essential to adapt our services. Deprecating less-used coins helps us maintain a high-quality platform.
    Low market capitalization and user activity: Metrics such as market cap and the number of non-zero balances indicate decreased relevance and usage of these coins among our users.

 
We understand that removing coins is a significant change, but it is necessary to maintain the best possible experience for the majority of our users.

What does this mean for users?
Starting with the February 2025 release of Trezor Suite, the affected coins will no longer be supported. Here's what you need to know:

    Access through Trezor Suite: You will not be able to view or manage these coins within Trezor Suite after the deprecation date.
    Continued backend support: Backends for these coins will remain operational until the end of July 2025. This allows you to use older versions of Trezor Suite if necessary to access your funds.
    Action required: We recommend migrating your funds to alternative wallets before the deprecation to ensure uninterrupted access and security.


Which Trezor models are affected?
Only Trezor Model T and Trezor Model One will be affected by this change; the latest devices (Safe 3 and Safe 5) do not support the affected coins. Future hardware releases will not support these coins.

Managing Ethereum & ERC-20 Tokens in Trezor Suite

Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain-based platform that enables the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dapps). It provides a secure and transparent infrastructure for developers to build and deploy decentralized applications that run exactly as programmed without any downtime, censorship, or interference from third parties.
